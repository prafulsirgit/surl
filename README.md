## For Developers

### Getting Started (Local Setup)

URL Genie is built with Python and Flask, using SQLite for its database. It's designed to be straightforward to set up and run.

#### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.6+
  * `pip` (Python package installer)

#### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/prafulsirgit/surl.git
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    python app.py

### Code Overview

  * **`app.py`**:
      * **`init_db()`**: Initializes the SQLite database, creating the `urls` table if it doesn't exist.
      * **`generate_code()`**: Generates a random alphanumeric short code for URLs without a custom alias.
      * **`delete_expired()`**: A crucial function that periodically cleans up the database by removing URLs older than 3 days. This helps maintain performance and relevancy.
      * **`index()` route (`/`)**: Handles both displaying the shortening form (GET) and processing URL submission (POST). It manages custom alias conflicts and stores new URLs.
      * **`redirect_to_original()` route (`/<short_code>`)**: This is the core redirection logic. It fetches the original URL based on the `short_code` and redirects the user, or returns a 404 if the link is not found or expired.
  * **`short.db`**: An SQLite database file. This lightweight database is perfect for a simple application like URL Genie, requiring no external setup.
  * **`templates/index.html`**: The front-end HTML template for the URL shortening interface.

### Future Enhancements (Ideas for Contribution\!)

  * **User Accounts:** Allow users to manage their shortened URLs, view statistics, and track clicks.
  * **Click Analytics:** Implement basic click tracking for shortened URLs (e.g., number of clicks, geographical data).
  * **QR Code Generation:** Automatically generate QR codes for each shortened URL.
  * **API Endpoints:** Provide a RESTful API for programmatic URL shortening.
  * **Containerization:** Dockerize the application for easier deployment.
  * **Robust Error Handling:** More sophisticated error handling and user feedback.
  * **Enhanced UI/UX:** Improve the user interface with modern styling and responsiveness.
